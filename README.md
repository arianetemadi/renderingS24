Rendering: Path Tracing
===

Project for the course Rendering, Summer 2024 at TU Wien.

Scene:
Couch lit by the Moonlight

The couch, cushions, and the blanket are sculpted from scratch in Blender, with the help of the cloth simulation tool and cloth brushes.
The moonlight shines in through the blinds of a window.
There are roughly 2 million triangles in the scene.
